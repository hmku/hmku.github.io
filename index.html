        <h1>Hello World.</h1>
        <p>I'm Harrison and this is my personal website.</p>
        <p>        Walking around the Jacobs School of Engineering, I often overhear students complaining about academics. I remember hearing one student confide to her friend that she spent the whole night crying because she “failed her midterm” and could no longer transfer into her intended major. Another student who couldn’t finish his programming assignment in time ended up smashing half of the computers in the computer science labs in a fit of frustration.
        </p>
        <p>        Studies have consistently shown that happiness isn’t, and shouldn’t be, dependent on external achievements. Yet, as a college student majoring in computer engineering, I find myself in an environment where achievements often define one’s well-being. In fact, one of the most common reasons why students seek emotional support at UCSD is “poor academic performance.” What is it about the environment at UC San Diego that changes how people’s emotions respond to events in their lives?
        </p>
        <p>        The answer is clear: especially within the engineering department, life-defining milestones like choosing a college major or landing a job are often completely dependent on a student’s academic achievements. A large portion of engineering majors require students to meet a certain GPA in order to declare. This means that one failed midterm or test could cost someone their dream education and prevent them from pursuing their passion in college. In addition, internship opportunities and referrals are consistently awarded by professors to those with the top grades, leaving students in the middle a crucial step behind when applying to careers in the industry.
        </p>
        <p>        Many of my peers have experienced these setbacks firsthand. One upperclassman who described himself as “usually very stoic” admitted to breaking down when he studied the wrong chapters for a math final and did extremely poorly as a result. Another friend fumed about being completely bypassed for internship opportunities from professors simply because he had only recently transferred into computer science and didn’t have as stacked of a resume as other students had.
        </p>
        <p>        The problem with an environment in which individuals’ emotions are based off of their academic success is that not everyone can be successful all the time. As a result, many individuals will inevitably find themselves depressed or angry at some point. Based on my experiences as a engineering student and my interactions with my peers, I can confirm that this is definitely true. If the UC San Diego faculty really cares about its students’ well-being and happiness, they shouldn’t actively promote an environment where students’ moods are completely dependent on external factors like grades and achievements. Instead, they should strive to remove any connection between the two so that one doesn’t affect the other. 
        </p>
        <p>        The first step that the administration should take is to remove the GPA requirement for transferring majors. Whether a student can major in a certain subject should be based upon their interest in and willingness to pursue that subject, not upon their previous academic achievement. Instead, academic departments should evaluate major transfer applications based on factors such as the student’s demonstrated interest in the subject. This would relieve much of the pressure on students to perform well academically and prevent a student’s aspirations and happiness from being completely devastated by, for example, a missed quiz or a bad grade on a test.
        </p>
        <p>        In addition, the engineering faculty should stop rewarding students with important opportunities on the basis of their academic performance. By offering certain students contacts and referrals to well-established companies, professors are essentially giving high-achieving students a significant leg up on other students who may not be as academically proficient. As a result, a student who receives a poor grade on a test could miss out on landing their dream internship or job, causing them to be extremely upset and disappointed. Prohibiting this process altogether would make the application process more fair and cause students’ happiness to be less affected by their academic results.
        </p>
        <p>        My roommate, a bioengineering major, once confided in me that grades were the primary source of stress in his life. If the UC San Diego administration truly wants to improve the well-being of its students, then it should do its best to prevent this from happening. In real life, happiness isn’t dependent on achievements, and it shouldn’t be—so it’s up to the school to create an environment where students can be happy regardless of what they manage to achieve.
